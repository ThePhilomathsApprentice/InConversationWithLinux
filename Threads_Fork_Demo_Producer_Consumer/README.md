# Threads_Fork_Demo_Producer_Consumer

Hey guys!

Compile and run both codes on separate terminals, \
and type your message in producer process, \
to demonstrate Producer-Consumer model.

run `$ test.sh` for generating 'mainProd' and 'mainCon' executables.
run `$ ./mainProd` and then `$ ./mainCon` on 2 different terminals.

Write in mainProd and expect the string character-wise on mainCon terminal.
